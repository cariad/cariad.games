      alt: A screenshot from "Wilmot Works it Out". The background is a drawing of a bathroom with a cactus, a toilet, a bath, a potted plant, a sink and a bookcase. Wilmot, a white square with a kind smiling face, is having a bubble bath. The wall is yellow with cloud patterns and jigsaw puzzles hanging on the wall as art. The pictures are a school of fish, a deep-sea diver, a photograph of a tourist standing in front of the Tower of Pisa, and a collection of hardware tools.

      alt: A screenshot from "Wilmot Works it Out". The background is a drawing of an empty living room. The centre of the screen has a dialogue box labelled "Sam the Postwoman". Sam is a kind-looking and smiling woman, wearing a cap, short-sleeve shirt and shorts. She's carrying a messenger bag of mail, and is holding some letters. She is saying "Morning Wilmot, how are you? Good news - I have that parcel for you - that one you've been waiting for, from that Puzzle Club subscription you signed up for Look, it has their stamp on the labelâ€¦" The player has the option to "take delivery".

      alt: A screenshot from "Wilmot Works it Out". There are several square jigsaw puzzle pieces on a carpeted floor, including pieces of a snail with legs, a worm wearing a cowboy hat poking out of a red apple, and a bit of a path through lush green grass. In the centre is Wilmot, a white square character, who is holding a piece of the snail image and is about to complete that puzzle.
