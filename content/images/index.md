      alt: A screenshot from "Wilmot Works it Out". The background is a drawing of a bathroom with a cactus, a toilet, a bath, a potted plant, a sink and a bookcase. Wilmot, a white square with a kind smiling face, is having a bubble bath. The wall is yellow with cloud patterns and jigsaw puzzles hanging on the wall as art. The pictures are a school of fish, a deep-sea diver, a photograph of a tourist standing in front of the Tower of Pisa, and a collection of hardware tools.

Good news - I have that parcel for you - that one you've been waiting for, from that Puzzle Club subscription you signed up for Look, it has their stamp on the label…" The player has the option to "take delivery".

      alt: A screenshot from "Wilmot Works it Out". There are several square jigsaw puzzle pieces on a carpeted floor, including pieces of a snail with legs, a worm wearing a cowboy hat poking out of a red apple, and a bit of a path through lush green grass. In the centre is Wilmot, a white square character, who is holding a piece of the snail image and is about to complete that puzzle.
